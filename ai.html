    <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Wesley Schiegg</h1>
    <h2>Computer Science Student â€¢ Systems-Focused Developer â€¢ Globally-Minded Problem Solver</h2>

    <p>
      Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at Texas A&M University with a strong foundation in systems programming, data structures, and hardware-level design.
      My academic and project work spans from building a custom Hack-style CPU in HDL and developing multithreaded Java systems, to implementing
      memory-efficient data structures and working hands-on with algorithmic complexity and concurrency.
    </p>

    <p>
      I approach problems with both a low-level curiosity and high-level strategy â€” constantly digging into how things work, why they break,
      and how to make them better. I believe in writing code thatâ€™s precise, maintainable, and built with purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond technical development, I recently completed a global marketing course at Korea University in Seoul, South Korea.
      That experience sharpened my ability to think across disciplines and cultures â€” blending technical insight with business and user-centered thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm always looking to build things that are both technically sound and practically useful â€” and to keep learning from every challenge.
    </p>

    <div class="prompt-box">
        <h3>Prompt:</h3>
      Can you give me a professional description of me that would be used in a portfolio site intro?
      Mention what I have accomplished in computer science and that I completed a marketing course at a study abroad in South Korea.
