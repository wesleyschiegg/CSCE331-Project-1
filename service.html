        <p>I would like to be more involved in giving back to the community in the near future. I am hoping 
            to get involved in <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">The Big Event</a> here at Texas A&M this year. 
            I have always wanted to participate in it but I have not been able to these past couple years due 
            to other commitments. I love the idea of doing something that helps the community and want to finally 
            be able to do my part this year. I also am looking to get involved in other community service activities 
            during the rest of my time here at Texas A&M by joining organizations that participate in those.
        </p>
