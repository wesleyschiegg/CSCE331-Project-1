        <p>I would like to be more involved in giving back to the community in the near future. I am hoping 
            to get involved in <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">The Big Event</a> here at Texas A&M this year. 
            I have always wanted to participate in it but I have not been able to these past couple years due 
            to other commitments. I love the idea of doing something that helps the community and want to finally 
            be able to do my part this year. I also am looking to get involved in other community service activities 
            during the rest of my time here at Texas A&M by joining organizations that participate in those.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another volunteer event that I would like to take part in is <a href="https://www.habitat.org/">Habitat for Humanity</a>.
          They help build homes for people around the Bryan/College Station area and I feel like that's something
          that I could participate in. I would also like to pair my love for cooking with volunteering by getting 
          involved in <a href="https://capbv.org/programs/meals-on-wheels/">Meals on Wheels</a>. They help the home-bound 
          elderly by supplying meals to them when they are unable to secure one for themselves.
