        <h1>Technical Portfolio</h1>
        <p>As of right now, my technical portfolio is very limited but I am actively seeking new projects to work 
            on. Some projects that I would like to work on are anything working with artificial intelligence or 
            machine learning. I am very interested in this field of computer science because it is changing the 
            world rapidly at the moment. I would like to be one of the innovators in that field because I believe 
            that it will impact almost every industry. My interest in computer science is not only limited to 
            artificial intelligence or machine learning, however. I am open to exploring all of the different 
            categories of computer science through projects. There is not one category that I would say I am not 
            interested in. If I get the opportunity to work on an impactful project in any field of computer 
            science I would gladly take part. I feel as though I have learned a lot in computer science and am 
            now ready to take on a project that will help me gain valuable real-world experience.
        </p>

        <p>In addition to computer science, I am also minoring in business. I am very interested in the field of 
            business because I hope that someday I will be able to have the opportunity to be in a position where 
            I will be managing a company or a part of a company. I believe that the knowledge I ave gained and will 
            continue to gain through my business minor will help me greatly in the future in knowing how companies 
            operate and conduct business. In fact, I went abroad to South Korea last summer to study marketing to 
            further my progress towards my business minor. I gained valuable experience and knowledge about the 
            markets of other countries and was able to broaden my horizons by integrating into a completely 
            different culture.
